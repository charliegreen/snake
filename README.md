# snake

A clone of the classic game Snake, made for the [Uzebox](http://belogic.com/uzebox/index.asp).

## building

Currently my Makefile uses [this script](https://gist.github.com/charliegreen/b45b856b51b21e226446c80e7272d48d) to generate the tilemap includable files. I probably should have just used uze's gconvert tool; at some point I may remove this dependency, but this is how it is for now. Let me know if you have trouble getting it to work, if you want me to migrate to gconvert, or if you just want a copy of the .inc files.
